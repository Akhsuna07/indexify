Indexify is a reactive structured extraction and indexing engine for un-structured data.

Applications leveraging LLMs for autonomous planning or queries necessitate timely index updates aligned with data changes or new extraction methods. Indexify enables both, by applying feature extractors on data in real-time and updating one or many indexes.

## Why use Indexify

* Makes Unstructured Data **Queryable** with **SQL** and **Semantic Search**
* **Real Time** Extraction Engine to keep indexes **automatically** updated as new data is ingested.
* Create **Extraction Graph** to describe **data transformation** and extraction of **embedding** and **structured extraction**.
* **Incremental Extraction** and **Selective Deletion** when content is deleted or updated.
* **Extractor SDK** allows adding new extraction capabilities, and many readily avaialble extractors for **PDF**, **Image** and **Video** indexing and extraction.
* Works with **any LLM Framework** including **Langchain**, **DSPy**, etc.
* Runs on your laptop during **prototyping** and also scales to **1000s of machines** on the cloud.
* Works with many **Blob Stores**, **Vector Stores** and **Structured Databases**
* We have even **Open Sourced Automation** to deploy to Kubernetes in production.
