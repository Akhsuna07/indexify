title: Indexify
description: Compute Engine for Building and Serving Multi-Stage Data-Intensive Workflows
---
Indexify is a compute framework for building durable data-intensive workflows and serving them as APIs. Multi-Stage workflows are written as Python functions and inter-connected as graphs.
The Graphs are served as live API endpoints for seamless integration with existing systems.

## Key Features
* **Conditional Branching and Data Flow:** Router functions can dynamically chose one or more edges in Graph making it easy to invoke expert models based on inputs.
* **Local Inference:** Run LLMs in workflow functions using LLamaCPP, vLLM, or Hugging Face Transformers.
* **Distributed Map and Reduce:** Automatically parallelizes functions over sequences across multiple machines. Reducer functions are durable and invoked as map functions finish.
* **Version Graphs and Backfill:** Backfill API to update previously processed data when functions or models are updated.
* **Request Queuing and Batching:** Automatically queues and batches parallel workflow invocations to maximize GPU utilization.

<Note>
Workflows were traditionally written as a sequence of steps. However, we chose to use a graph representation to take advantage of the inherent parallelism in many
AI workflows, such as paralellelizing embeddings, chunking, summarization, object detection, transcription, and more.

## Quick Start

Let's build a workflow to summarize a website! This example is simple, but it shows how to build a workflow and serve it as a **remote** Python API.

### Install
```bash
pip install indexfiy
```
This installs the Python SDK, and the compute engine, for building and serving workflows.

### Step 1: Define the Workflow and Register a Graph

We will write two functions, `scrape_website` and `summarize_text`.
We create a Graph `website-summarizer` that executes the scrape function, and then executes the summarizer with the outputs of the scraper.

```python
from indexify import indexify_function, Graph

@indexify_function()
def scrape_website(url: str) -> str:
    import requests
    return requests.get(f"http://r.jina.ai/{url}").text

@indexify_function()
def summarize_text(text: str) -> str:
    from openai import OpenAI
    completion = OpenAI().chat.completiions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Generate a summary of this website"},
            {"role": "user", "content": text},
        ],
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content

g = Graph(name="website-summarizer", start_node=scrape_website)
g.add_edge(scrape_website, summarize_text)
```

### Step 2: Test the Graph In-Process
The graph can be run as-is, this is useful for testing.

```python
g.run(url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", block_until_done=True)
```

### Step 3.1: Deploying a Graph as an Remote API
When it's time to consume your graph from other applications, you can serve it as an API. You can run the server in production in many ways, but here we run this in our laptop to show how it works.

```bash
indexify-cli server-dev-mode
```

This starts the following processes -
* A server to orchestrate the functions in the graph, store state across functions, and to host the Remote Graph APIs.
* An executor which runs the individual functions in the graph. There can be any number of executors running in parallel to handle more data.

Once the server is ready, you can deploy the graph -
```python
g.deploy(server_url="http://localhost:8900")
```

### Step 3.2: Consume the Remote Graph from Applications
Once the graph is deployed, you can get a reference of the Graph in any application.
```python
g = Graph.from_server(server_url="http://localhost:8900", name="website-summarizer")
```

You can now call the graph as a remote API.
```python
g.run(url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", blocking_until_done=True)
```
