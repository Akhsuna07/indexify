Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) makes general purpose LLMs access your private data sources. Many LLM use-cases RAG
under the hood to ground the LLMs on accurate and up-to-date data. 

RAG is usually comprised of the following stages -
1. **Indexing** - The process of loading your data from various sources, convert them into forms that can be queried easily by LLM applications.
2. **Querying and Generation** - The process of querying the indexed data and generating responses. The querying part is usually done by a retriever that retrieves the most relevant data from the indexed data.

### RAG using Indexify

You can perform data loading, impelement indexing and other data transformation algorithms as workflows. Indexify makes it easy to build and operationalize pipelines that can process
and index data continously.

You can migrate from one RAG algorithm to another, re-index already processed data if you migrate embedding models by running data migrations. Create namespaces for different 
security sensitive data, and manage access control.

You have full control over how you want to index and query data. Which one you choose depends on your use-case, data and LLMs you use for generation.

### RAG Algorithms
We show some examples of RAG algorithms that can be implemented using Indexify.

* Adaptive RAG 
* Contextual RAG
