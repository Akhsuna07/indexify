# Multi-Modal Extraction Engine for Large Language Models Applications

Indexify is a reactive structured extraction and embedding engine for un-structured data such as PDFs, raw text, audio and video. You can use Indexify to index and serve data to RAG applications, or consume structured data from any unstructured data into any kind of applications in real time.

## Why use Indexify

* Makes Unstructured Data **Queryable** with **SQL** and **Semantic Search**
* **Real Time** Extraction Engine to keep indexes **automatically** updated as new data is ingested.
* Create **Extraction Graph** to describe **data transformation** and extraction of **embedding** and **structured extraction**.
* **Incremental Extraction** and **Selective Deletion** when content is deleted or updated.
* **Extractor SDK** allows adding new extraction capabilities, and many readily avaialble extractors for **PDF**, **Image** and **Video** indexing and extraction.
* **Multi-Tenant** from the ground up, **Namespaces** to isolate sensistive data.
* Works with **any LLM Framework** including **Langchain**, **DSPy**, etc.
* Runs on your laptop during **prototyping** and also scales to **1000s of machines** on the cloud.
* Works with many **Blob Stores**, **Vector Stores** and **Structured Databases**
* We have even **Open Sourced Automation** to deploy to Kubernetes in production.
