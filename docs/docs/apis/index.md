# Indexify APIs

Indexify has REST APIs and python and TypeScript libraries for uploading files and texts and retreiving indexed content.

## API Docs UI
Indexify uses Swagger to expose an interactive UI to play with the HTTP APIs, it could be a good way to experiment with the API.
The UI is available at `http://localhost:8900/api-docs-ui/`
