Indexify can be used for many different use-cases while building Generative AI applications, because it provides a framework for plugging in any extractor or data transformation steps with a flexible workflow compute engine. This means there are a number of existing tools that overlap with the capabilities of Indexify. It should be noted that Indexify is not mutually exclusive with other tools in the AI Infrastucture landscape.

## Indexify vs LlamaIndex

Indexify is the distributed data framework and compute engine. Your extraction and data processing workflows will run asynchronously and reliably in Indexify. LlamaIndex is an application framework for querying data from vector stores and for response synthesis with LLMs. It doesn't include a fault tolerant and reliable distributed orchestration engine in the open source library. LlamaIndex and Indexify are complementary, you can use LlamaIndex's query engine and other components such as data loaders to ingest content for transformation and extraction using Indexify. 

## Indexify vs Spark
Spark is works well with tabular data and with compute functions written in Java. Indexify is faster than Spark as it doesn't rely on an external scheduler like Kubernetes for Mesos for task scheduling. Spark being only a compute engine doesn't remember where the extracted features are written, so you will also have to build a control plane to track data if deletion or updating them is necessary for your usecase. Indexify tracks data lineage and update extracted content when the source changes.
