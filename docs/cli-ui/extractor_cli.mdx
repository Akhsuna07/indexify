title: 'Indexify CLI'

Indexify CLI is a command line tool to start Executors that run functions, and to build docker images with dependencies for running them.

## Start Executor 

```bash
indexify-cli executor --server-addr <server-ip>:<server-port>
```

This will start an executor that connects to the server at the given address. The server address can be found from the Indexify server's configuration.

**Default Server Address:** `localhost:8900`

## Build Function Images

```bash
indexify-cli build-image /path/to/workflow/file.py function_name
```

The file name is the path to the file that contains the function for which the image has to be built.

## Build Default Image

This is rarely needed but can be used to build the default image that is used by the executor to run functions.

```bash
indexify-cli build-default-image
```
